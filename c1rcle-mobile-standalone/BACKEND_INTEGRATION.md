# THE C1RCLE Mobile - Backend Integration Summary

## ✅ Connected to Real Backend

The mobile app is now fully connected to the same backend, database, and business logic as the website (guest portal).

---

## 🔐 Firebase Configuration

**Project**: `thec1rcle-india`  
**Location**: `lib/firebase/config.ts`

```typescript
projectId: "thec1rcle-india"
authDomain: "thec1rcle-india.firebaseapp.com"
storageBucket: "thec1rcle-india.firebasestorage.app"
```

✅ Same Firebase project as web - users, events, orders, tickets are shared.

## 🌐 API Configuration

**API Base URL**: `https://thec1rcle.com/api`  
**Location**: `lib/api/config.ts`

All ticketing operations call the same endpoints as the web guest portal:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/checkout/reserve` | Reserve ticket inventory |
| `/checkout/calculate` | Calculate pricing with discounts |
| `/checkout/initiate` | Start checkout & payment |
| `/checkout/promo` | Validate promo codes |
| `/tickets/share` | Create share bundles |
| `/tickets/claim` | Claim shared tickets |
| `/tickets/transfer` | Transfer ticket ownership |
| `/payments` | Verify Razorpay payments |

---

## 📊 Firestore Collections (Same as Web)

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `events` | All events (filtered by lifecycle) |
| `orders` | Paid orders |
| `rsvp_orders` | Free RSVP orders |
| `ticket_assignments` | Claimed tickets from shares |
| `notifications` | Push/in-app notifications |
| `users` | User profiles |
| `chats` | Event group chats |
| `dm_threads` | Direct messages |

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Events (Explore Tab)
```
eventsStore.fetchEvents()
  → Firestore query: events collection
  → Filter: lifecycle IN ['scheduled', 'live']
  → Filter: endDate >= now
  → Maps to Event type
```

### Tickets (My Tickets Tab)
```
ticketsStore.fetchUserOrders(userId)
  → Firestore query: orders WHERE userId == user.uid
  → Firestore query: rsvp_orders WHERE userId == user.uid  
  → Firestore query: ticket_assignments WHERE redeemerId == user.uid
  → Combines all into unified Order[] list
```

### Checkout
```
Mobile Cart → /checkout/reserve (hold inventory)
           → /checkout/calculate (get pricing)
           → /checkout/initiate (create order)
           → Razorpay payment
           → /payments (verify)
           → Order confirmed in Firestore
```
